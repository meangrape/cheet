# Cheat Sheet Dev Log

How are we going to implement?

Pandoc

Let's look at doing this in org-mode!

C-h : help
C-h d : search in documentation


python to svg / raster / pdf

drawing libs / simple text rendering.

# Concepts

Output to qwerty overlay?
inkscape??

rust ((resvg, piet))

# FIXME

Inputting a command with a trailing space crashes.  This is not preferable behavior (encountered when entering fields in 'vi' mode)

# TODO

:: I want jinja to escape things that look like html tags.
:: Also, jinja is currently displaying "None" when there are no tags.  This is not preferred.
:: Chrome-headless isn't rendering the bg for desc properly
:: Fix input behavior when adding < >. (these don't display due to html renders)
:: We need better editing behavior than "nuke and pave". Editing fields makes you write the whole thing from scratch.
 - autogenerated images
   - also, autogenerated colorschemes (I imagine that with a certain kind of math I could implement something that when fed a color, it could create a color that would be visible and pleasing when overlayed as a transparency)
 - Compiling by trait: I want to be able to show like, Rust-only bindings, emacs bindings, etc.
 - fuzzy finding: Tab completion would be rad.
:: I wanna be able to manage (CRUD) cheets by things like tab, label, etc
